This project is a simple Bash script that creates a backup of a user-specified file.
All backups are stored in a separate directory for better organization.
Each backup file includes a timestamp to avoid overwriting.
The script checks whether the file exists before creating a backup.
It is useful for learning basic Linux file handling and Bash scripting.
